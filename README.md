# HTCYFR Episode 1: Introduction

Welcome to the supplementary GitHub page for the HTCYFR tutorial series!
This GitHub is intended to store the course project files and other information from the tutorial videos for you to browse and learn from. Since there hasn't been any coding yet, this branch just give you some helpful resource links and advice to prepare you for programming Romis.

## Prerequisites

### Romi Parts

As of current, Blue Cheese 1086 already has some Romis already assembled and imaged for rookies to test out in school or at PCS, but if you need/want to buy your own Romi, you need a Romi Robot Kit for FIRST, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4, at least 6 AA rechargeable batteries. Links to the essential Romi parts can be found at the top of the "Getting Started with the Romi" section of the FRC Control System Documentation website. [Here's the link to the site](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/hardware.html).

(*The FRC Control System Documentation website is also a great place to learn more about the Romi and FRC programming overall, so check it out if you haven't yet*)

- The Romi Robot Kit for FIRST should be bought at [Pololu's website](https://www.pololu.com/product/4022), the manufacturer of the Romi.
- A Raspberry Pi can be bought from the [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BFH96M3/) in the FRC Control System Docs mentioned previously or from one of the vendors linked in the official [Raspberry Pi site](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/). The Raspberry Pi vendors tend to have cheaper prices, but you may get a better deal with the shipping price from the Amazon link.
- Any 6 Double-A batteries will do, but the FRC Control System Docs suggest rechargeable ones from [this Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TW9T8JW/?th=1). You also need to buy a micro USB charger to charge the batteries.
- The [microSD card Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073K14CVB/) from the FRC Control System Docs is recommended since it also comes with an adapter, allowing the microSD to be imaged inside of a regular SD card. The site also recommends that the microSD card is 8 GB or larger.

### Personal Computer

Your personal computer must have enough storage to download multiple software for imaging and programming the Romi. School computers are not recommended since it's likely that some of the necessary software is blocked from being downloaded.

For imaging purposes, make sure your computer has an available SD or microSD card port. If not, you may need to buy the [microSD card reader], also linked in the FRC Control System Docs.

### Proficiency in Java

Blue Cheese uses Java as its programming language to code our robots, both the off-season and competition ones. Thus, it's essential that you are proficient at Java before starting to code Romis, especially object-oriented code. To learn Java, the team recommends that you make an account on *Codecademy* and complete the entire ["Learn Java" course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) linked here, though any other Java teaching resources may also do. Please pay extra attention to the Object-oriented Java section because a lot of the syntax for the robot code written by our team, and FRC teams in general, is explained by object-oriented code.
