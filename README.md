# HTCYFR Supplemental GitHub page

Welcome to the supplementary GitHub page for the HTCYFR tutorial series!
This GitHub is intended to store the course project files and other information from the tutorial videos for you to browse and learn from. Each video in the tutorial series has its own branch, containing documented course files and other relevant information in them. If you've just started watching the tutorial series, please start at the Episode-1-Introduction branch and work your way through the rest of the episodes and their corresponding branches.

## Main Branch

This main branch essentially culminates the code from the other branches into one. If you want to just the code onto your Romi to mess with all features made, this branch is for you. Before diving into the code though, I have few things I want to make clear:

- **The bulk of the code provided belongs to FIRST and WPILib!** For this tutorial series, I will primarily be writing on top of premade example code, including code comments, that was written by the contributors for FIRST and WPILib. The java files made by them should have a copyright statement at the top of the file, and there's also the WPILib-License.md file that describes their copyright conditions.
- **I will differentiate my own code comments with a "- ".** If you see a code comment "// - with a hyphen before it, like this" then it's my own documentation that I added to explain certain code aspects, mostly for the code I typed. Any other code comments without the leading hyphen is likely pre-written by WPILib.
