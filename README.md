# HTCYFR Episode 2: Assembly

This GitHub page will go over information from parts of the Assembly episode. If you haven't watched or seen this or the previous HTCYFR episode or GitHub branch, I recommend you do so before reading this page.

## Required Parts

### Romi Parts

Information on what parts you must buy to make a Romi can be found on the [FRC Control System Documentation website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/hardware.html), which is talked about in the previous Episode-1-Introduction GitHub branch. Here's a list of what things you need specifically for assembly.

- [Romi Robot Kit for FIRST](https://www.pololu.com/product/4022)
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4
- Six Double-A batteries, especially [rechargeable ones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TW9T8JW/?th=1)
- A mini-screwdriver

The [microSD card and adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073K14CVB/) will be needed later for imaging the Romi in the next episode.

### Romi Robot Kit for FIRST

When your Romi Robot Kit finally delivers, you should see a Polulu box with all the parts for the base Romi. The box should contain:

- The Romi Chassis with a pre-soldered 32U4 Control Board
- 2 Motor Clips
- 2 Mini Plaster Gearmotors with encoders
- 2 Wheel Hubs and Tires
- 2 Ball Casters with rollers and caster chassis
- USB A to micro-B Adapter Cable
