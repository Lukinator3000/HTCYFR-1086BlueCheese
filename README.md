# HTCYFR Supplemental GitHub page

Welcome to the supplementary GitHub page for the HTCYFR tutorial series!
This GitHub is intended to store the course project files and other information from the tutorial videos for you to browse and learn from. Each video in the tutorial series has its own branch, containing documented course files and other relevant information in them. If you've just started watching the tutorial series, please start at the Episode-1-Introduction branch and work your way through the rest of the episodes and their corresponding branches.

## Main Branch

This main branch essentially culminates the code from the other branches into one. If you want to just the code onto your Romi to mess with all features made, this branch is for you.
