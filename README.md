# HTCYFR Episode 9: Project Demonstration

Above is my attempt at writing Romi code from the ground up using WPILib's Romi template project, which can be created by selecting "template" -> "java" -> "Romi - Command Robot" when creating a new WPILib project.

Due to time constraint, both concerning the length of the video and deadline to deliver the project, I only managed to write the ArcadeDrive and DriveTime files with updates in RomiDrivetrain and RobotContainer.
